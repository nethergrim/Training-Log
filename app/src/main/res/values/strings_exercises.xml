    <string name="info_text_1">The main objective of this application - replace the paper training diary at something more useful and smart \ n</string>
    <string name="info_question_2">How to use this application?</string>
    <string name="info_text_2">They can be used just like ordinary paper diary and training.
        \nStart training (eg training of the legs) , turn on the app , choose standard training legs, or you have created a training program on its feet.
        \nIf you are just starting to engage with the program , the weights and reps will be on the unit. But if you exercise more than one exercise for each training program
        the application starts prompt and put a value from a previous workout. For example, squats . You train a second week with this application ,
        run it in training, and what you see ? You see that last workout you " sat down " with a weight of 100kg 15 times (for example) . But you know that for muscle growth , the need for progress loads
        so now you have to do 100kg 17 times in the first approach (for example) . And so on all the training .</string>
    <string name="info_question_3">What\'s in it for me?</string>
    <string name="info_text_3">Continued progress in the power load - most effective way to build muscle mass.
        \nMuscles quickly become accustomed to a constant load , you can see for yourself how people in gyms for years trained with the same weights and stand still in progress.
        \nPeople involved so years. Reach any result and then trampled on it for years. Over time, the habit is fixed , and people are not even aware , and not particularly committed to progress. However, if you run a training diary for you all the way. Sense and the basic idea of ​​the diary - to seek progress load , which leads to an increase in strength and muscle . Remember, if there is nothing around you does not change ( weight on the equipment ), you ( your muscles ) is also no reason to change ( grow and become stronger) .</string>
    <string name="info_question_4">Why? I remember the weight!</string>
    <string name="info_text_4">Very often lazy adherents say the following: " Haha I keep a diary ? I have a good memory and I can remember without notes . " Mon ami , without notes - you\'re a bug , both literally and figuratively, if we are talking about bodybuilding . First, without a diary , you will remember , at best, a maximum weight of one working approach ( 105 kg . Shrugged 6 - five times , and how much shrugged and rested in the following - it is not clear ) . Second came the next workout you will likely deliver those same 105 kg and pozhmesh their 6 - five times , ie without progression, because you will not have a clear idea when and how to load progress .</string>
    <string name="info_question_5">Why does it work?</string>
    <string name="info_text_5">Because when you train properly with the diary , you are in a state of constant struggle for progress . Each workout is filled with your clear meaning . Before each exercise approach you look at the number of repetitions and the weight that you overcame it last training session and try to go beyond this . You have a very clear objective - to add in one of the working approaches more reps or weight work , without loss results in other approaches and working exercises.
\nGain can be microscopic . For example, if you shook last workout 105 kg 7 -NIL times , try to shake 106 kg 7 -NIL or 105 -Th 8 -NIL or 105 -Th 7 -NIL and a half ( let them help partner doge half ) . BUT these increases should be. You should strive to make them ALWAYS ! And even if you exercise this month easily (within periodization ) , you will always remember that this is only for one purpose - to make further gain . You may find that 1 kg bench press - it is very small , but count how many you add a year at the rate of growth - the scales at 4 kg per month. It\'s a crazy figure - 48 kg ! And I assure you, if you\'ll reap technically lying 150 kg ( the right muscles ), the size of your shoulder girdle sooooo MUCH grows compared to the old 105 kg . And besides themselves give meaning to your workout . It is this nuance , by the way , features sports and physical culture , friends. Fighting for the best result - is a sport ! Everything else - this exercise .
\nProgress can load your muscles mass of different ways. You can , for example, reduce the rest between sets , increase the number of approaches themselves , change the forum of the exercise , change the speed of the movement , many of the principles used to increase the intensity . However, in this sense, I agree with Mr. Murphy, who said that the more complex and graceful plan , the greater the chance that it will fail . All these complex ways to increase the intensity only confuse the novice and will bring more chaos in his head than use his muscles. So remember , your task progressed weight training weights ! That is the problem you will solve handily thanks training diary .</string>
    <string name="info_question_6">OK, I\'m doing on my diary but power rates are falling! = (</string>
    <string name="info_text_6">Sometimes it happens . And well , you saw it in its statistics . Now you need to give your body more time to recover .
\nIn this case, there are two ways , and it is better to use both of them ( at a set weight) .
\n1 - Increase the time between workouts of the same group. Especially the large muscle groups . ( For example train each group more than once in 7 days, and every 10 days . Your muscles will have more time to recover , and they will be compensated in excess of the resources spent , thereby grow.)
\n2 - Increase the caloric intake and the amount of protein in the diet. Add 300-500 calories to your diet , and look at the statistics in 2-3 weeks , your power rates should go up!</string>
    <string name="info_question_7">Diary and loads of periodization</string>
    <string name="info_text_7">Whichever classroom genetics you did not have , as it were scrupulously from workout to workout did not try to increase your weight working on the equipment . In any case, at some point there will be " stop " when a further increase in the linear weights are obtained cease . There are two solutions .
\n1 - Do not change ( try to continue to increase linearly weight)
\n2 - Reduce weight ( step step back ) , then to add more ( to move forward )
\nThe first method in the presence of the diary will also work . Only the growth rate very slow . But it is better to go slowly than all the years to stand without moving. Right? But the second way , when you reduce the load , and then rested a certain amount of training, take more weight than originally (not linear progress ) has proven effective in all sports . Actually , this method is called pereodizatsiey . When you move forward, not in a straight line , and using an undulating effect. Reminds me that great of a sail forward - perpendicular to the wind using a different tack (movement different tacks ) . During light load (moving in the wind ), you dial the desired inertia ( speed) to progress with a heavy load ( motion perpendicular to the wind ) . And set the desired inertia (speed) takes longer than the actual forward movement . In general, you do two steps back (or on the side, so if you prefer ) , in order to then take a step or half-step forward.
\nSo , my friends, to work correctly under pereodizatsii training diary you vital. Because in it you will very clearly see and know how to train for each specific training. Usually in training diary signs plan " active rest " with a gradual ( from workout to workout ) buildup loads to marginal . Such a vast array of numbers and accurate data on all approaches , repetitions and exercises to remember is simply not possible and therefore necessary diary (plan ) for their illustrations .</string>
    <string name="info_question_8">Analysis based on a training diary</string>
    <string name="info_text_8">In addition to the progression of loads, a training diary gives you the unique opportunity for analysis. With it, you can improve his / her training programme depending on what works and what doesn\'t.
\nIt so happens that you are in a state of stagnation. To get out of it you need to know how. For this, the first thing you do is take your training diary and see that you have worked effectively, and what is not. Look for the cause of stagnation or causes of «breakthroughs». For example, did you notice, now, the progress in the bench press is much slower than it was 5 months ago. Previously, you could easily add 2 kg every practice, but now even 1 kg for you is hard. See, then, that the training was different, and you see then after pressing you did three approaches on the uneven bars. It is quite possible that the effectiveness of the previous program was better because of this nuance. Try and see. Or another situation, you need to return to pull rod in the slope of you 3 months not made replaced the cravings dumbbell in one hand).  What weight you took in traction rods in all operational approaches you tell a training diary, as well as that if you stronger or not. In General, diary helps you construct a more appropriate personal program with high efficiency.
\nIt is quite possible that you will make mistakes (choose not effective exercises or make them not effective volume/form), that is quite acceptable. The main thing that you saw these errors and correct them. This can often only through in-depth analysis of the training diary. YOU try something out and see the result.  If the decision was a mistake, again going to change something. Ultimately, you always go forward, even if you did something wrong.</string>
    <string name="info_question_9">Tip: do not change often training program</string>
    <string name="info_text_9">Otherwise you will have little «reference points» for analysis and you never know what really works and what doesn\'t.
\nAnother very important advantage of the training diary is to improve your motivation. At some point you can begin to eat doubt: am I doing everything right? Why slowed growth? I\'m not sure that I can achieve such results as professionals...etc. to Struggle with doubts will also help the training diary: you just flip through it for the last year and see how changing your achievements . You see that are not standing still and that there is progress.  It calms you and returns your psyche on the «usual rails».</string>

        <string name="ex_1_0">\nThis exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack just above shoulder level. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.
\n\nHold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.
\n\nStep away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder-width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times and maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position.
\n\nBegin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees and sitting back with your hips as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until your hamstrings are on your calves. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.
\n\nBegin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel or middle of your foot as you straighten the legs and extend the hips to go back to the starting position.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
\n\nThis type of squat allows a greater range of motion, and allows the trunk to maintain a more vertical position than other types of squats, due to foot position and the higher bar position.</string>
    <string name="ex_1_1">\n\nUsing a leg press machine, sit down on the machine and place your legs on the platform directly in front of you at a medium (shoulder width) foot stance. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section).
\n\nLower the safety bars holding the weighted platform in place and press the platform all the way up until your legs are fully extended in front of you. Tip: Make sure that you do not lock your knees. Your torso and the legs should make a perfect 90-degree angle. This will be your starting position.
\n\nAs you inhale, slowly lower the platform until your upper and lower legs make a 90-degree angle.
\n\nPushing mainly with the heels of your feet and using the quadriceps go back to the starting position as you exhale.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and ensure to lock the safety pins properly once you are done. You do not want that platform falling on you fully loaded.
\n\nCaution: Always check to make sure that when you re-rack the weight the platform is securely locked.

\n\nVariations: All foot stance variations described in the foot stance section.</string>
    <string name="ex_1_2">\n\nTo begin, first set the bar in a rack slightly below shoulder level. Rest the bar on top of the deltoids, pushing into the clavicles, and lightly touching the throat. Your hands should be in a clean grip, touching the bar only with your fingers to help keep it in position.
\n\nLift the bar off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso. Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head and elbows up at all times. This will be your starting position.
\n\nBend at the knees, sitting down between your legs. Continue down until your hamstrings are on your calves. Keep your knees aligned with your feet by consciously using your abductors to push your knees out as you squat.
\n\nBegin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor mainly with the heel or middle of your foot as you straighten the legs again and return to the starting position.</string>
    <string name="ex_1_3">To begin, first set the bar to a position that best matches your height. Once the bar is loaded, step under it and position it across the back of your shoulders.
\n\nTake the bar with your hands facing forward, unlock it and lift it off the rack by extending your legs.
\n\nMove your feet forward about 18 inches in front of the bar. Position your legs using a shoulder width stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Look forward at all times and maintain a neutral or slightly arched spine. This will be your starting position.
\n\nSlowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper and lower leg breaks 90 degrees.
\n\nBegin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heels of your feet, extending the knees and returning to the starting position.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.</string>
    <string name="ex_1_4">Place the back of your torso against the back pad of the machine and hook your shoulders under the shoulder pads provided.
\n\nPosition your legs in the platform using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Tip: Keep your head up at all times and also maintain the back on the pad at all times.
\n\nPlace your arms on the side handles of the machine and disengage the safety bars (which on most designs is done by moving the side handles from a facing front position to a diagonal position).
\n\nNow straighten your legs without locking the knees. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section).
\n\nBegin to slowly lower the unit by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up (back on the pad at all times). Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.
\n\nBegin to raise the unit as you exhale by pushing the floor with mainly with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
\n\nVariations: All foot variations discussed in the foot positioning section apply.</string>
    <string name="ex_1_5">For this exercise you will need to use a leg extension machine. First choose your weight and sit on the machine with your legs under the pad (feet pointed forward) and the hands holding the side bars. This will be your starting position. Tip: You will need to adjust the pad so that it falls on top of your lower leg (just above your feet). Also, make sure that your legs form a 90-degree angle between the lower and upper leg. If the angle is less than 90-degrees then that means the knee is over the toes which in turn creates undue stress at the knee joint. If the machine is designed that way, either look for another machine or just make sure that when you start executing the exercise you stop going down once you hit the 90-degree angle.
\n\nUsing your quadriceps, extend your legs to the maximum as you exhale. Ensure that the rest of the body remains stationary on the seat. Pause a second on the contracted position.
\n\nSlowly lower the weight back to the original position as you inhale, ensuring that you do not go past the 90-degree angle limit.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of times.
\n\nVariations: As mentioned at in the foot positioning section, you can use various foot positions in order to maximize stimulation of certain thigh areas. Also, you can perform the movement unilaterally (one leg at a time).</string>
    <string name="ex_1_6">Adjust the machine lever to fit your height and lie face down on the leg curl machine with the pad of the lever on the back of your legs (just a few inches under the calves). Tip: Preferably use a leg curl machine that is angled as opposed to flat since an angled position is more favorable for hamstrings recruitment.
\n\nKeeping the torso flat on the bench, ensure your legs are fully stretched and grab the side handles of the machine. Position your toes straight (or you can also use any of the other two stances described on the foot positioning section). This will be your starting position.
\n\nAs you exhale, curl your legs up as far as possible without lifting the upper legs from the pad. Once you hit the fully contracted position, hold it for a second.
\n\nAs you inhale, bring the legs back to the initial position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
\n\nCaution: Do not ever use so much weight on the exercise that you start using swinging and jerking as you can risk both lower back injury and also a hamstring injury.

\n\nVariations: Since you have three foot positions you have in reality three exercises. The movement can also be performed with a dumbbell held in between your feet (a partner needs to place it properly). This latter exercise though is only suitable for advanced trainees. Finally, it is also possible to just use one leg at a time for better isolation.</string>
    <string name="ex_1_7">Put a barbell in front of you on the ground and grab it using a pronated (palms facing down) grip that a little wider than shoulder width. Tip: Depending on the weight used, you may need wrist wraps to perform the exercise and also a raised platform in order to allow for better range of motion.
\n\nBend the knees slightly and keep the shins vertical, hips back and back straight. This will be your starting position.
\n\nKeeping your back and arms completely straight at all times, use your hips to lift the bar as you exhale. Tip: The movement should not be fast but steady and under control.
\n\nOnce you are standing completely straight up, lower the bar by pushing the hips back, only slightly bending the knees, unlike when squatting. Tip: Take a deep breath at the start of the movement and keep your chest up. Hold your breath as you lower and exhale as you complete the movement.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
\n\nCaution: This is not an exercise that is recommended for people with lower back problems. Also, it needs to be treated with the utmost respect paying special attention not to round the back forward too much as you move the torso. Finally, jerking motions or doing too much weight can injure your back.

\n\nVariation: The exercise can also be performed with dumbbells in each hand.</string>
    <string name="ex_1_8">Sit on the machine and place your toes on the lower portion of the platform provided with the heels extending off. Choose the toe positioning of your choice (forward, in, or out) as per the beginning of this chapter.
\n\nPlace your lower thighs under the lever pad, which will need to be adjusted according to the height of your thighs. Now place your hands on top of the lever pad in order to prevent it from slipping forward.
\n\nLift the lever slightly by pushing your heels up and release the safety bar. This will be your starting position.
\n\nSlowly lower your heels by bending at the ankles until the calves are fully stretched. Inhale as you perform this movement.
\n\nRaise the heels by extending the ankles as high as possible as you contract the calves and breathe out. Hold the top contraction for a second.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.</string>
    <string name="ex_1_9">Adjust the padded lever of the calf raise machine to fit your height.
\n\nPlace your shoulders under the pads provided and position your toes facing forward (or using any of the two other positions described at the beginning of the chapter). The balls of your feet should be secured on top of the calf block with the heels extending off it. Push the lever up by extending your hips and knees until your torso is standing erect. The knees should be kept with a slight bend; never locked. Toes should be facing forward, outwards or inwards as described at the beginning of the chapter. This will be your starting position.
\n\nRaise your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down.
\n\nGo back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
\n\nCaution: If you suffer from lower back problems, a better exercise is the calf press as during a standing calf raise the back has to support the weight being lifted. Also, maintain your back straight and stationary at all times. Rounding of the back can cause lower back injury.

\n\nVariations: There are several other ways to perform a standing calf raise. A barbell instead of a machine can be used instead as well as dumbbells, one leg or two legs at a time. Refer to the exercise descriptions of these movements below. A smith machine can be used for calf raises as well.</string>
    <string name="ex_1_10">Begin standing with your feet shoulder width apart and your hands on your hips.
\n\nStep forward with one leg, flexing the knees to drop your hips. Descend until your rear knee nearly touches the ground. Your posture should remain upright, and your front knee should stay above the front foot.
\n\nDrive through the heel of your lead foot and extend both knees to raise yourself back up.
\n\nStep forward with your rear foot, repeating the lunge on the opposite leg.</string>
    <string name="ex_1_11">Stand up straight while holding a dumbbell on each hand (palms facing the side of your legs).
\n\nPlace the right foot on the elevated platform. Step on the platform by extending the hip and the knee of your right leg. Use the heel mainly to lift the rest of your body up and place the foot of the left leg on the platform as well. Breathe out as you execute the force required to come up.
\n\nStep down with the left leg by flexing the hip and knee of the right leg as you inhale. Return to the original standing position by placing the right foot of to next to the left foot on the initial position.
\n\nRepeat with the right leg for the recommended amount of repetitions and then perform with the left leg.
\n\nNote: This is a great exercise for people with lower back problems that are unable to do stiff legged deadlifts.

\n\nVariations: Just like lunges, this exercise can also be performed by alternating between the right and the left leg every time until all repetitions have been performed for both legs. Also, a barbell can be used for resistance. Beginners can start with only the bodyweight, especially if they have balance issues.</string>
    <string name="ex_1_12">To begin, first set the bar on the height that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.
\n\nHold on to the bar using both arms at each side (palms facing forward), unlock it and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.
\n\nPosition your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).
\n\nBegin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.
\n\nBegin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
\n\nCaution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly. If you have back issues, substitute it with leg presses instead. If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly.

\n\nVariations: As previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.

\n\nYou can also place a small block under the heels to improve balance.</string>
    <string name="ex_1_13">Adjust the machine lever to fit your height and lie with your torso bent at the waist facing forward around 30-45 degrees (since an angled position is more favorable for hamstrings recruitment) with the pad of the lever on the back of your right leg (just a few inches under the calves) and the front of the right leg on top of the machine pad.
\n\nKeeping the torso bent forward, ensure your leg is fully stretched and grab the side handles of the machine. Position your toes straight. This will be your starting position.
\n\nAs you exhale, curl your right leg up as far as possible without lifting the upper leg from the pad. Once you hit the fully contracted position, hold it for a second.
\n\nAs you inhale, bring the legs back to the initial position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
\n\nPerform the same exercise now for the left leg.</string>
    <string name="ex_0_0">Lie back on a flat bench. Using a medium width grip (a grip that creates a 90-degree angle in the middle of the movement between the forearms and the upper arms), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. This will be your starting position.
\n\nFrom the starting position, breathe in and begin coming down slowly until the bar touches your middle chest.
\n\nAfter a brief pause, push the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out. Focus on pushing the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms and squeeze your chest in the contracted position at the top of the motion, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: Ideally, lowering the weight should take about twice as long as raising it.
\n\nRepeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
\n\nWhen you are done, place the bar back in the rack.
\n\nCaution:

\n\nIf you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used.

\n\nAlso, beware of letting the bar drift too far forward. You want the bar to touch your middle chest and nowhere else.

\n\nDon\'t bounce the weight off your chest. You should be in full control of the barbell at all times.</string>
    <string name="ex_0_1">Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand resting on top of your thighs. The palms of your hands will be facing each other.
\n\nThen, using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells up, lift the dumbbells one at a time so that you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width.
\n\nOnce at shoulder width, rotate your wrists forward so that the palms of your hands are facing away from you. The dumbbells should be just to the sides of your chest, with your upper arm and forearm creating a 90 degree angle. Be sure to maintain full control of the dumbbells at all times. This will be your starting position.
\n\nThen, as you breathe out, use your chest to push the dumbbells up. Lock your arms at the top of the lift and squeeze your chest, hold for a second and then begin coming down slowly. Tip: Ideally, lowering the weight should take about twice as long as raising it.
\n\nRepeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program.
\n\nCaution: When you are done, do not drop the dumbbells next to you as this is dangerous to your rotator cuff in your shoulders and others working out around you.

\n\nJust lift your legs from the floor bending at the knees, twist your wrists so that the palms of your hands are facing each other and place the dumbbells on top of your thighs. When both dumbbells are touching your thighs simultaneously push your upper torso up (while pressing the dumbbells on your thighs) and also perform a slight kick forward with your legs (keeping the dumbbells on top of the thighs). By doing this combined movement, momentum will help you get back to a sitting position with both dumbbells still on top of your thighs. At this moment you can place the dumbbells on the floor.

\n\nVariations:

\n\nAnother variation of this exercise is to perform it with the palms of the hands facing each other.

\n\nAlso, you can perform the exercise with the palms facing each other and then twisting the wrist as you lift the dumbbells so that at the top of the movement the palms are facing away from the body. I personally do not use this variation very often as it seems to be hard on my shoulders.</string>
    <string name="ex_0_2">Lie back on an incline bench. Using a medium-width grip (a grip that creates a 90-degree angle in the middle of the movement between the forearms and the upper arms), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. This will be your starting position.
\n\nAs you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar on you upper chest.
\n\nAfter a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position, squeeze your chest, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: it should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.
\n\nRepeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
\n\nWhen you are done, place the bar back in the rack.
\n\nCaution: If you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used. Also, beware of letting the bar drift too far forward. You want the bar to fall on your upper chest and nowhere else.

\n\nVariations: You can use several angles on the incline bench if the one you are using is adjustable.</string>
    <string name="ex_0_3">Lie back on an incline bench with a dumbbell in each hand atop your thighs. The palms of your hands will be facing each other.
\n\nThen, using your thighs to help push the dumbbells up, lift the dumbbells one at a time so that you can hold them at shoulder width.

    <string name="ex_2_0">Attach a weight to a dip belt and secure it around your waist. Grab the pull-up bar with the palms of your hands facing forward. For a medium grip, your hands should be spaced at shoulder width. Both arms should be extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip.
\n\nYouâ€™ll want to bring your torso back about 30 degrees while creating a curvature in your lower back and sticking your chest out. This will be your starting position.
\n\nNow, exhale and pull your torso up until your head is above your hands. Concentrate on squeezing yourshoulder blades back and down as you reach the top contracted position.
\n\nAfter a brief moment at the top contracted position, inhale and slowly lower your torso back to the starting position with your arms extended and your lats fully stretched.</string>
    <string name="ex_2_1">Sit down on a pull-down machine with a wide bar attached to the top pulley. Adjust the knee pad of the machine to fit your height. These pads will prevent your body from being raised by the resistance attached to the bar.
\n\nGrab the pull-down bar with the palms facing your torso (a supinated grip). Make sure that the hands are placed closer than the shoulder width.
\n\nAs you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position.
\n\nAs you breathe out, pull the bar down until it touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the fully contracted position and keep the elbows close to your body. The upper torso should remain stationary as your bring the bar to you and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar.
\n\nAfter a second on the contracted position, while breathing in, slowly bring the bar back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched.
\n\nRepeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.</string>
    <string name="ex_2_2">This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.
\n\nHold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.
\n\nStep away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position.
\n\nKeeping your legs stationary, move your torso forward by bending at the hips while inhaling. Lower your torso until it is parallel with the floor.
\n\nBegin to raise the bar as you exhale by elevating your torso back to the starting position.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
\n\nCaution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly. Be cautious with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The stiff-legged barbell good morning is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly.</string>
    <string name="ex_2_3">Sit down on a pull-down machine with a wide bar attached to the top pulley. Make sure that you adjust the knee pad of the machine to fit your height. These pads will prevent your body from being raised by the resistance attached to the bar.
\n\nGrab the bar with the palms facing forward using the prescribed grip. Note on grips: For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than your shoulder width. For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width.
\n\nAs you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso and head forward. Think of an imaginary line from the center of the bar down to the back of your neck. This is your starting position.
\n\nAs you breathe out, bring the bar down until it touches the back of your neck by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work except for holding the bar; therefore do not try to pull down the bar using the forearms.
\n\nAfter a second on the contracted position squeezing your shoulder blades together, slowly raise the bar back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched. Inhale during this portion of the movement.
\n\nRepeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
\n\nCaution: Performing this exercise can be hard on the rotator cuffs and if not properly executed can cause an injury to occur. Also, if you already have rotator cuff issues, I advise you to stick to the front pull-down version.

\n\nVariations: You can also performing this exercise by bring the bar down and touching your chest. This variation is safer and not as hard on the rotator cuffs.</string>
    <string name="ex_2_4">For this exercise you will need access to a low pulley row machine with a V-bar. Note: The V-bar will enable you to have a neutral grip where the palms of your hands face each other. To get into the starting position, first sit down on the machine and place your feet on the front platform or crossbar provided making sure that your knees are slightly bent and not locked.
\n\nLean over as you keep the natural alignment of your back and grab the V-bar handles.
\n\nWith your arms extended pull back until your torso is at a 90-degree angle from your legs. Your back should be slightly arched and your chest should be sticking out. You should be feeling a nice stretch on your lats as you hold the bar in front of you. This is the starting position of the exercise.
\n\nKeeping the torso stationary, pull the handles back towards your torso while keeping the arms close to it until you touch the abdominals. Breathe out as you perform that movement. At that point you should be squeezing your back muscles hard. Hold that contraction for a second and slowly go back to the original position while breathing in.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
\n\nCaution: Avoid swinging your torso back and forth as you can cause lower back injury by doing so.

\n\n\n\nVariations:

\n\nYou can use a straight bar instead of a V-Bar and perform with a pronated grip (palms facing down-forward) or a supinated grip (palms facing up-reverse grip).</string>
    <string name="ex_2_5">Stand in front of a loaded barbell.
\n\nWhile keeping the back as straight as possible, bend your knees, bend forward and grasp the bar using a medium (shoulder width) overhand grip. This will be the starting position of the exercise. Tip: If it is difficult to hold on to the bar with this grip, alternate your grip or use wrist straps.
\n\nWhile holding the bar, start the lift by pushing with your legs while simultaneously getting your torso to the upright position as you breathe out. In the upright position, stick your chest out and contract the back by bringing the shoulder blades back. Think of how the soldiers in the military look when they are in standing in attention.
\n\nGo back to the starting position by bending at the knees while simultaneously leaning the torso forward at the waist while keeping the back straight. When the weights on the bar touch the floor you are back at the starting position and ready to perform another repetition.
\n\nPerform the amount of repetitions prescribed in the program.
\n\nCaution:

\n\nThis is not an exercise to be taken lightly. If you have back issues, substitute it for a rowing motion instead.
\n\nIf you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never round the back as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.
\n\nVariations: Dumbbells can be used as well though I find the bar version easier to perform.</string>
    <string name="ex_2_6">Lie face down on a hyperextension bench, tucking your ankles securely under the footpads.
\n\nAdjust the upper pad if possible so your upper thighs lie flat across the wide pad, leaving enough room for you to bend at the waist without any restriction.
\n\nWith your body straight, cross your arms in front of you (my preference) or behind your head. This will be your starting position. Tip: You can also hold a weight plate for extra resistance in front of you under your crossed arms.
\n\nStart bending forward slowly at the waist as far as you can while keeping your back flat. Inhale as you perform this movement. Keep moving forward until you feel a nice stretch on the hamstrings and you can no longer keep going without a rounding of the back. Tip: Never round the back as you perform this exercise. Also, some people can go farther than others. The key thing is that you go as far as your body allows you to without rounding the back.
\n\nSlowly raise your torso back to the initial position as you inhale. Tip: Avoid the temptation to arch your back past a straight line. Also, do not swing the torso at any time in order to protect the back from injury.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
\n\nVariations: This exercise can also be performed without a hyperextension bench, but in this case you will need a spotter. Also, a similar exercise to this one is the good morning and the stiff-legged deadlift.</string>
    <string name="ex_2_7">Stand erect while holding a barbell with a supinated grip (palms facing up).
\n\nBend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward, by bending at the waist, while keeping the back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor. Tip: Make sure that you keep the head up. The barbell should hang directly in front of you as your arms hang perpendicular to the floor and your torso. This is your starting position.
\n\nWhile keeping the torso stationary, lift the barbell as you breathe out, keeping the elbows close to the body and not doing any force with the forearm other than holding the weights. On the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a second.
\n\nSlowly lower the weight again to the starting position as you inhale.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
\n\nCaution:

\n\nThis exercise is not recommended for people with back problems. A Low Pulley Row is a better choice for people with back issues.
\n\nAlso, just like with the bent knee dead-lift, if you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury.
\n\nBe cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.
\n\nVariations: You can perform the same exercise using a pronated (palms facing out) grip or using dumbbells.</string>
    <string name="ex_2_8">Choose a flat bench and place a dumbbell on each side of it.
\n\nPlace the right leg on top of the end of the bench, bend your torso forward from the waist until your upper body is parallel to the floor, and place your right hand on the other end of the bench for support.
\n\nUse the left hand to pick up the dumbbell on the floor and hold the weight while keeping your lower back straight. The palm of the hand should be facing your torso. This will be your starting position.
\n\nPull the resistance straight up to the side of your chest, keeping your upper arm close to your side and keeping the torso stationary. Breathe out as you perform this step. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. Also, make sure that the force is performed with the back muscles and not the arms. Finally, the upper torso should remain stationary and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work except for holding the dumbbell; therefore do not try to pull the dumbbell up using the forearms.
\n\nLower the resistance straight down to the starting position. Breathe in as you perform this step.
\n\nRepeat the movement for the specified amount of repetitions.
\n\nSwitch sides and repeat again with the other arm.
\n\nVariations: One-arm rows can also be performed using a high pulley or a low pulley instead of a dumbbell.</string>
    <string name="ex_2_9">Put weight on one of the ends of an Olympic barbell. Make sure that you either place the other end of the barbell in the corner of two walls; or put a heavy object on the ground so the barbell cannot slide backward.
\n\nBend forward until your torso is as close to parallel with the floor as you can and keep your knees slightly bent.
\n\nNow grab the bar with both arms just behind the plates on the side where the weight was placed and put your other hand on your knee. This will be your starting position.
\n\nPull the bar straight up with your elbows in (to maximize back stimulation) until the plates touch your lower chest. Squeeze the back muscles as you lift the weight up and hold for a second at the top of the movement. Breathe out as you lift the weight. Tip: Use a stirrup or double handle cable attachment by hooking it under the end of the bar.
\n\nSlowly lower the bar to the starting position getting a nice stretch on the lats. Tip: Do not let the plates touch the floor. To ensure the best range of motion, I recommend using small plates (25-lb ones) as opposed to larger plates (like 35-45lb ones).
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
\n\nVariations: You can perform this exercise using a low pulley or T-bar row machine.</string>
    <string name="ex_2_10">Stand erect with a dumbbell on each hand (palms facing your torso), arms extended on the sides.
\n\nLift the dumbbells by elevating the shoulders as high as possible while you exhale. Hold the contraction at the top for a second. Tip: The arms should remain extended at all times. Refrain from using the biceps to help lift the dumbbells. Only the shoulders should be moving up and down.
\n\nLower the dumbbells back to the original position.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
\n\nVariations: You can perform this exercise with bands, barbells or cables. You can also use a single handle and work one side at a time.</string>
    <string name="ex_2_11">Stand up straight with your feet at shoulder width as you hold a barbell with both hands in front of you using a pronated grip (palms facing the thighs). Tip: Your hands should be a little wider than shoulder width apart. You can use wrist wraps for this exercise for a better grip. This will be your starting position.
\n\nRaise your shoulders up as far as you can go as you breathe out and hold the contraction for a second. Tip: Refrain from trying to lift the barbell by using your biceps.
\n\nSlowly return to the starting position as you breathe in.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
\n\nVariations: You can also rotate your shoulders as you go up, going in a semicircular motion from front to rear. However this version is not good for people with shoulder problems. In addition, this exercise can be performed with the barbell behind the back, with dumbbells by the side, a smith machine or with a shrug machine.</string>
    <string name="ex_3_0">Sit on a Military Press Bench with a bar behind your head and either have a spotter give you the bar (better on the rotator cuff this way) or pick it up yourself carefully with a pronated grip (palms facing forward). Tip: Your grip should be wider than shoulder width and it should create a 90-degree angle between the forearm and the upper arm as the barbell goes down.
\n\nOnce you pick up the barbell with the correct grip length, lift the bar up over your head by locking your arms. Hold at about shoulder level and slightly in front of your head. This is your starting position.
\n\nLower the bar down to the collarbone slowly as you inhale.
\n\nLift the bar back up to the starting position as you exhale.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
\n\nVariations:

\n\nThis exercise can also be performed standing but those with lower back problems are better off performing this seated variety.
\n\nThe behind the neck variation is not recommended for people with shoulder problems as it can be hard on the rotator cuff due to the hyperextension created by bringing the bar behind the neck.</string>
    <string name="ex_3_1">Sit on an exercise bench with back support and hold two dumbbells in front of you at about upper chest level with your palms facing your body and your elbows bent. Tip: Your arms should be next to your torso. The starting position should look like the contracted portion of a dumbbell curl.
\n\nNow to perform the movement, raise the dumbbells as you rotate the palms of your hands until they are facing forward.
\n\nContinue lifting the dumbbells until your arms are extended above you in straight arm position. Breathe out as you perform this portion of the movement.
\n\nAfter a second pause at the top, begin to lower the dumbbells to the original position by rotating the palms of your hands towards you. Tip: The left arm will be rotated in a counter clockwise manner while the right one will be rotated clockwise. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
\n\nVariations: You can perform the exercise standing up but that is not recommended for people with lower back issues.</string>
    <string name="ex_3_2">While holding a dumbbell in each hand, sit on a military press bench or utility bench that has back support. Place the dumbbells upright on top of your thighs.
\n\nNow raise the dumbbells to shoulder height one at a time using your thighs to help propel them up into position.
\n\nMake sure to rotate your wrists so that the palms of your hands are facing forward. This is your starting position.
\n\nNow, exhale and push the dumbbells upward until they touch at the top.
\n\nThen, after a brief pause at the top contracted position, slowly lower the weights back down to the starting position while inhaling.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
\n\nVariations: You can perform the exercise standing or sitting on a regular flat bench. For people with lower back problems, the version described is the recommended one.

\n\nYou can also perform the exercise as Arnold Schwarzenegger used to do it, which is to start holding the dumbbells with a supinated grip (palms facing you) in front of your shoulders and then, as you start pushing up, you align the dumbbells in the starting position described on step 3 by rotating your wrists and touch the dumbbells at the top. As you come down, then you would go back to the starting position by rotating the wrist throughout the lowering portion until the palms of your hands are facing you. This variation is called the Arnold Press. However, it is not recommended if you have rotator cuff problems.</string>
    <string name="ex_3_3">Beginning Position:

\n\nUse the floor-to-shoulder lifting technique described in the Power Clean exercise to move the bar from the floor to the shoulders.
\n\nUpward Movement Phase:

\n\nSlightly flex the hips and knees, keeping torso erect.
\n\nImmediately follow with an explosive push upward by extending the knees.
\n\nKeep torso erect and tensed.
\n\nAt maximum hip and knee extension, shift body weight to balls of feet and extend ankle joints.
\n\nAt maximum plantar flexion, push bar from the shoulders.
\n\nPush the bar with the arms to a fully extended elbow position overhead.
\n\nDownward Movement Phase:

\n\nLower bar to shoulders.
\n\nFlex hips and knees slightly as bar touches shoulders.
\n\nStraighten the hips and knees before the upward movement phase begins again.
\n\nBreathing:

\n\nExhale through the sticking point of the upward movement phase.
\n\nInhale during the downward movement phase.</string>
    <string name="ex_3_4">Grasp a barbell with an overhand grip that is slightly less than shoulder width. The bar should be resting on the top of your thighs with your arms extended and a slight bend in your elbows. Your back should also be straight. This will be your starting position.
\n\nNow exhale and use the sides of your shoulders to lift the bar, raising your elbows up and to the side. Keep the bar close to your body as you raise it. Continue to lift the bar until it nearly touches your chin. Tip: Your elbows should drive the motion, and should always be higher than your forearms. Remember to keep your torso stationary and pause for a second at the top of the movement.
\n\nLower the bar back down slowly to the starting position. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
\n\nVariations: This exercise can also be performed using a straight bar attached to a low pulley and it can also be performed using dumbbells, though this later exercise should be reserved by people that are well familiarized with correct execution.</string>
    <string name="ex_3_5">Stand up with your torso upright and a dumbbell on each hand being held at arms length. The elbows should be close to the torso.
\n\nThe palms of the hands should be facing your torso. Your feet should be about shoulder width apart. This will be your starting position.
\n\nKeeping your arms straight and the torso stationary, lift the weights out to your sides until they are about shoulder level height while exhaling.
\n\nFeel the contraction for a second and begin to lower the weights back down to the starting position while inhaling. Tip: Keep the palms facing down with the little finger slightly higher while lifting and lowering the weights as it will concentrate the stress on your shoulders mainly.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
\n\nVariations: There are many possible variations for this movement. For instance, you can perform the exercise sitting down on a bench with or without back support and you can also perform it by alternating arms; first lift the right arm for one repetition, then the left, then the right, etc.</string>
    <string name="ex_3_6">Pick a couple of dumbbells and stand with a straight torso and the dumbbells on front of your thighs at arms length with the palms of the hand facing your thighs. This will be your starting position.
\n\nWhile maintaining the torso stationary (no swinging), lift the dumbbells to the front with a slight bend on the elbow and the palms of the hands always facing down. Continue to go up until you arms are slightly above parallel to the floor. Exhale as you execute this portion of the movement and pause for a second at the top.
\n\nAs you inhale, lower the dumbbells back down slowly to the starting position.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
\n\nVariations: This exercise can also be performed by alternating hands, meaning doing one repetition with the right arm, and then one with the left, back to the right, etc. Also, you could use a barbell as well.</string>
    <string name="ex_3_7">To begin, lie down on an incline bench with the chest and stomach pressing against the incline. Have the dumbbells in each hand with the palms facing each other (neutral grip).
\n\nExtend the arms in front of you so that they are perpendicular to the angle of the bench. The legs should be stationary while applying pressure with the ball of your toes. This is the starting position.
\n\nMaintaining the slight bend of the elbows, move the weights out and away from each other (to the side) in an arc motion while exhaling. Tip: Try to squeeze your shoulder blades together to get the best results from this exercise.
\n\nThe arms should be elevated until they are parallel to the floor.
\n\nFeel the contraction and slowly lower the weights back down to the starting position while inhaling.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.</string>
    <string name="ex_3_8">Adjust the handles so that they are fully to the rear. Make an appropriate weight selection and adjust the seat height so the handles are at shoulder level. Grasp the handles with your hands facing inwards. This will be your starting position.
\n\nIn a semicircular motion, pull your hands out to your side and back, contracting your rear delts.
\n\nKeep your arms slightly bent throughout the movement, with all of the motion occurring at the shoulder joint.
\n\nPause at the rear of the movement, and slowly return the weight to the starting position.</string>
    <string name="ex_3_9">Stand up straight while holding a barbell using a wide (higher than shoulder width) and overhand (palms facing your body) grip.
\n\nBend knees slightly and bend over as you keep the natural arch of your back. Let the arms hang in front of you as they hold the bar. Once your torso is parallel to the floor, flare the elbows out and away from your body. Tip: Your torso and your arms should resemble the letter "T". Now you are ready to begin the exercise.
\n\nWhile keeping the upper arms perpendicular to the torso, pull the barbell up towards your upper chest as you squeeze the rear delts and you breathe out. Tip: When performed correctly, this exercise should resemble a bench press in reverse. Also, refrain from using your biceps to do the work. Focus on targeting the rear delts; the arms should only act as hooks.
\n\nSlowly go back to the initial position as you breathe in.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
\n\nVariations: You can perform this exercise using a smith machine or a T-bar row. You can also use the low pulley as long as you use a wide grip bar attachment.</string>
    <string name="ex_4_0">Stand up with your torso upright while holding a barbell at a shoulder-width grip. The palm of your hands should be facing forward and the elbows should be close to the torso. This will be your starting position.
\n\nWhile holding the upper arms stationary, curl the weights forward while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Tip: Only the forearms should move.
\n\nContinue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second and squeeze the biceps hard.
\n\nSlowly begin to bring the bar back to starting position as your breathe in.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
\n\nVariations:

\n\nYou can also perform this movement using a straight bar attachment hooked to a low pulley. This variation seems to really provide a good contraction at the top of the movement.
\n\nYou may also use the closer grip for variety purposes.</string>
    <string name="ex_4_1">Stand up straight with a dumbbell in each hand at arms length. Keep your elbows close to your torso and rotate the palms of your hands until they are facing forward. This will be your starting position.
\n\nNow, keeping the upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the weights while contracting your biceps. Continue to raise the weights until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.
\n\nThen, inhale and slowly begin to lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
\n\nVariations: There are many possible variations for this movement. For instance, you can perform the exercise sitting down on a bench with or without back support and you can also perform it by alternating arms; first lift the right arm for one repetition, then the left, then the right, etc.

\n\nYou can also do the exercise starting with both palms of the hands facing the torso and then rotating forward as the movement is performed. At the top of the movement the palms should face forward and the small finger should be higher than the thumb for a peak contraction.</string>
    <string name="ex_4_2">To perform this movement you will need a preacher bench and an E-Z bar. Grab the E-Z curl bar at the close inner handle (either have someone hand you the bar which is preferable or grab the bar from the front bar rest provided by most preacher benches). The palm of your hands should be facing forward and they should be slightly tilted inwards due to the shape of the bar.
\n\nWith the upper arms positioned against the preacher bench pad and the chest against it, hold the E-Z Curl Bar at shoulder length. This will be your starting position.
\n\nAs you breathe in, slowly lower the bar until your upper arm is extended and the biceps is fully stretched.
\n\nAs you exhale, use the biceps to curl the weight up until your biceps is fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder height. Squeeze the biceps hard and hold this position for a second.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
\n\nVariations: You can perform this exercise also using a low pulley with an E-Z Bar attachment instead. In this case you will need to position the bench in front of the pulley. You may also use a wider grip for variety purposes.</string>
    <string name="ex_4_3">Grab a dumbbell with the right arm and place the upper arm on top of the preacher bench or the incline bench. The dumbbell should be held at shoulder length. This will be your starting position.
\n\nAs you breathe in, slowly lower the dumbbell until your upper arm is extended and the biceps is fully stretched.
\n\nAs you exhale, use the biceps to curl the weight up until your biceps is fully contracted and the dumbbell is at shoulder height. Again, remember that to ensure full contraction you need to bring that small finger higher than the thumb.
\n\nSqueeze the biceps hard for a second at the contracted position and repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
\n\nSwitch arms and repeat the movement.
\n\nVariations: You can perform this exercise using a low pulley instead of a dumbbell. In this case you will need to position the bench in front of the pulley.</string>
    <string name="ex_4_4">To begin, set a weight that is comfortable on each side of the pulley machine. Note: Make sure that the amount of weight selected is the same on each side.
\n\nNow adjust the height of the pulleys on each side and make sure that they are positioned at a height higher than that of your shoulders.
\n\nStand in the middle of both sides and use an underhand grip (palms facing towards the ceiling) to grab each handle. Your arms should be fully extended and parallel to the floor with your feet positioned shoulder width apart from each other. Your body should be evenly aligned the handles. This is the starting position.
\n\nWhile exhaling, slowly squeeze the biceps on each side until your forearms and biceps touch.
\n\nWhile inhaling, move your forearms back to the starting position. Note: Your entire body is stationary during this exercise except for the forearms.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions prescribed in your program.
\n\nVariations: This exercise can also be performed using one handle at a time.</string>
    <string name="ex_4_5">Stand up with your torso upright while holding a barbell at shoulder width with the elbows close to the torso. The palm of your hands should be facing down (pronated grip). This will be your starting position.
\n\nWhile holding the upper arms stationary, curl the weights while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Only the forearms should move. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the muscle.
\n\nSlowly begin to bring the bar back to starting position as your breathe in.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
\n\nVariations: You can also perform this movement using an E-Z attachment hooked to a low pulley. This variation seems to really provide a good contraction at the top of the movement. You can also use an E-Z bar as well.</string>
    <string name="ex_4_6">Stand up with your torso upright and a dumbbell on each hand being held at arms length. The elbows should be close to the torso.
\n\nThe palms of the hands should be facing your torso. This will be your starting position.
\n\nNow, while holding your upper arm stationary, exhale and curl the weight forward while contracting the biceps. Continue to raise the weight until the biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbell is at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a brief moment as you squeeze the biceps. Tip: Focus on keeping the elbow stationary and only moving your forearm.
\n\nAfter the brief pause, inhale and slowly begin the lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
\n\nVariations: There are many possible variations for this movement. For instance, you can perform the exercise sitting down on a bench with or without back support and you can also perform it by alternating arms; first lift the right arm for one repetition, then the left, then the right, etc.</string>
    <string name="ex_5_0">Lie back on a flat bench. Using a close grip (around shoulder width), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. This will be your starting position.
\n\nAs you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar on your middle chest. Tip: Make sure that - as opposed to a regular bench press - you keep the elbows close to the torso at all times in order to maximize triceps involvement.
\n\nAfter a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your triceps muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.
\n\nRepeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
\n\nWhen you are done, place the bar back in the rack.
\n\nCaution: If you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used. Also, beware of letting the bar drift too far forward. You want the bar to fall on your middle chest and nowhere else.

\n\nVariations: This exercise can also be performed with an e-z bar using the inner handle as well as dumbbells, in which case the palms of the hands will be facing each other.</string>
    <string name="ex_5_1">Secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and slowly lay down on the bench.
\n\nUsing a close grip (a grip that is slightly less than shoulder width), lift the EZ bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked and elbows in. The arms should be perpendicular to the floor. This will be your starting position. Tip: In order to protect your rotator cuff, it is best if you have a spotter help you lift the barbell off the rack.
\n\nAs you breathe in and you keep the upper arms stationary, bring the bar down slowly by moving your forearms in a semicircular motion towards you until you feel the bar slightly touch your forehead. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement.
\n\nLift the bar back to the starting position by contracting the triceps and exhaling.
\n\nRepeat until the recommended amount of repetitions is performed.
\n\nVariations: You can use a straight bar or dumbbells to perform this movement. You can also perform it on a flat bench as well.</string>
    <string name="ex_5_2">To begin, stand up with a dumbbell held by both hands. Your feet should be about shoulder width apart from each other. Slowly use both hands to grab the dumbbell and lift it over your head until both arms are fully extended.
\n\nThe resistance should be resting in the palms of your hands with your thumbs around it. The palm of the hands should be facing up towards the ceiling. This will be your starting position.
\n\nKeeping your upper arms close to your head with elbows in and perpendicular to the floor, lower the resistance in a semicircular motion behind your head until your forearms touch your biceps. Tip: The upper arms should remain stationary and only the forearms should move. Breathe in as you perform this step.
\n\nGo back to the starting position by using the triceps to raise the dumbbell. Breathe out as you perform this step.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
\n\nVariations:

\n\nAnother way to perform this exercise is to use an e-z or straight bar instead in which case you will be holding the bar from the inside (around 5 inches between both hands) with the palms facing forward (pronated grip).
\n\nThere is also a bar that has parallel bars inside (often referred to as a triceps blaster) and this can also be used for this exercise.
\n\nFinally, a low pulley cable with a rope attachment or bar (straight or e-z) attachment at the end can be used as well for variety purposes as well.</string>
    <string name="ex_5_3">Attach a V-Bar to a high pulley and grab with an overhand grip (palms facing down) at shoulder width.
\n\nStanding upright with the torso straight and a very small inclination forward, bring the upper arms close to your body and perpendicular to the floor. The forearms should be pointing up towards the pulley as they hold the bar. The thumbs should be higher than the small finger. This is your starting position.
\n\nUsing the triceps, bring the bar down until it touches the front of your thighs and the arms are fully extended perpendicular to the floor. The upper arms should always remain stationary next to your torso and only the forearms should move. Exhale as you perform this movement.
\n\nAfter a second hold at the contracted position, bring the V-Bar slowly up to the starting point. Breathe in as you perform this step.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
\n\nVariations: There are many variations to this movement. For instance you can use an E-Z bar attachment as well as a straight cable bar attachment for different variations of the exercise. Also, you can attach a rope to the pulley as well as using a reverse grip on the bar exercises.

\n\nJust like the Triceps Pushdown but with the V-Bar attachment.</string>
    <string name="ex_6_0">Begin by lying on your back on the ground. Your legs should be straight and your arms at your side. This will be your starting position.
\n\nTo perform the movement, tuck the knees toward your chest by flexing the hips and knees. Following this, extend your legs directly above you so that they are perpendicular to the ground. Rotate and elevate your pelvis to raise your glutes from the floor.
\n\nAfter a brief pause, return to the starting position.</string>
    <string name="ex_6_1">Position your body on the vertical leg raise bench so that your forearms are resting on the pads next to the torso and holding on to the handles. Your arms will be bent at a 90 degree angle.
\n\nThe torso should be straight with the lower back pressed against the pad of the machine and the legs extended pointing towards the floor. This will be your starting position.
\n\nNow as you breathe out, lift your legs up as you keep them extended. Continue this movement until your legs are roughly parallel to the floor and then hold the contraction for a second. Tip: Do not use any momentum or swinging as you perform this exercise.
\n\nSlowly go back to the starting position as you breathe in.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
\n\nVariations: As you become more advanced you can start to rotate your pelvis forward at the top of the movement to really engage the lower abs. You may also straighten your legs to increase the difficulty of this movement.</string>
    <string name="ex_6_2">Kneel 1-2 feet in front of a cable system with a rope attached.
\n\nAfter selecting an appropriate weight, grasp the rope with both hands reaching overhead. Your torso should be upright in the starting position.
\n\nTo begin, flex at the spine, attempting to bring your rib cage to your legs as you pull the cable down.
\n\nPause at the bottom of the motion, and then slowly return to the starting position.
\n\nThese can be done with twists or to the side to hit the obliques.</string>
    <string name="ex_6_3">Lie down on the floor and secure your feet. Your legs should be bent at the knees.
\n\nPlace your hands behind or to the side of your head. You will begin with your back on the ground. This will be your starting position.
\n\nFlex your hips and spine to raise your torso toward your knees.
\n\nAt the top of the contraction your torso should be perpendicular to the ground. Reverse the motion, going only Â¾ of the way down.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.</string>
    <string name="ex_6_4">Secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and lie down.
\n\nNow place your hands lightly on either side of your head keeping your elbows in. Tip: Dont lock your fingers behind your head.
\n\nWhile pushing the small of your back down in the bench to better isolate your abdominal muscles, begin to roll your shoulders off it.
\n\nContinue to push down as hard as you can with your lower back as you contract your abdominals and exhale. Your shoulders should come up off the bench only about four inches, and your lower back should remain on the bench. At the top of the movement, contract your abdominals hard and keep the contraction for a second. Tip: Focus on slow, controlled movement - dont cheat yourself by using momentum.
\n\nAfter the one second contraction, begin to come down slowly again to the starting position as you inhale.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
\n\nVariations: There are many variations for the crunch. You can perform the exercise with weights, or on top of an exercise ball or on a flat bench.</string>
